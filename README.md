NC Backend:

Overview:
NC Backend is about seeding, building and testing an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. This will be mimicing building of a real-world backend service so that it could provide information for the front-endrchitecture.

How to set up the .env files:

- create 2 new files, one for development and one for test. Be sure to call it appropriately starting with '.env.' followed by type of file.

- Within both files a database needs to be added for local machine to access it. This is written as 'PGDATABASE=' followed by the name of the database.

After hosting with Supabase and Render, the following URL should show the API Links:
https://ncnews-iv7p.onrender.com/

Adding the endpoints should give the fetched data.
